# Note: Adafruit_DHT handles GPIO cleanup internally for its operations,
# so an explicit GPIO.cleanup() is often not strictly necessary here,
# unless you were doing other direct RPi.GPIO operations in the same script.
# For simplicity and robust practice, if you use RPi.GPIO directly anywhere else,
# ensure cleanup.
